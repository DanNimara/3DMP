        2. Divide the mechanism into components
        3. Use Fusion Rule Number 1
        4. Use suggestive names for your bodies, components, sketches, joints,
          contact points, construction planes or any element that you include in your
          project
        5. Create a stand for the mechanism (like “Holder” component made in
          Course 5 videos) so they will not levitate
        6. Add joints and create a motion study
        7. Add appearances and render the mechanism (upload a rendering photo to
          GitHub as well) 
          
        OBS: Turn on capture history (the homework will not be graded if capture
        history is not turned on).  
        You need to upload the project as .f3d and a .stl for each projects’ body
        and component.  
        BONUS: Design the evolution door following 2-7 steps from the homework tasks.  
        You can choose one from the next two versions:
