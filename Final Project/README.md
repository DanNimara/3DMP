### Description

A civil defense siren (also known as an air-raid siren or tornado siren) is a siren used to provide an emergency population warning to the general population of approaching danger. It is sometimes sounded again to indicate the danger has passed. Some sirens (especially within small towns) are also used to call the volunteer fire department when needed. Initially designed to warn city dwellers of air raids in World War II, they were later used to warn of nuclear attack and natural destructive weather patterns such as tornadoes. The generalized nature of the siren led to many of them being replaced with more specific warnings, such as the broadcast based Emergency Alert System and the Cell Broadcast based Wireless Emergency Alerts and EU-Alert mobile technologies.

A mechanical siren generates sound by spinning a slotted chopper wheel to interrupt a stream of air at a regular rate. Modern sirens can develop a sound level of up to 135 decibels at 100 feet (30 m). 
The one I designed is a Hand Crank Air-Raid Siren. Similar to the sirens used in WWII to warn people of air-raids, the Viking Horns hand crank siren is a siren that gives an eerie sound when cranked and will surely get anyone's attention in the room. Perfect for annoying the neighbors, your family, people at a music festival, or just creeping people out in general, the hand crank siren is certainly perfect for any occasion. Plus, it's just a cool piece of history!

### Mechanism - joints, components

The mechanism is composed of 17 components(7 of which are different types of screws!). The crank is moving the spur gear at the back of the holder, which in turn rotates a screw on which another spur gear is mounted. The second spur gear comes into contact with another screw which rotates the rotor(the most important part) and produces the sound (as described above). 
I based the motion study on the revolute joint of the Crank-Holder Screw.

 Tasks:   
 - [x] Start the design from the canvases or the sketches created by
 yourself for Homework no.6. (1 point)   
 - [x] Respect FUSION RULE NUMBER ONE. (1.5 points)  
 - [x] Save multiple versions and suggestively name them. (1 point)   
 - [x] Properly use and name bodies, components, joints, construction
   planes, etc. (1.5 points)   
 - [x] Render the object applying appearance and scene. (0.5 points)  
 - [x] Save the renderings as photos and as a VIDEO Render. (0.5
      points)   
 - [x] Add joints, motion links and joint limits. (1.5 points)  
 - [x] Create motion studies. (0.5 points)  
 - [x] The mechanism needs to work properly! (2 points)  
 
I designed and rendered the mechanism in Autodesk Fusion 360 with a little help from Inkscape for the writing on the front cap. In my repository I have .f3d, .stl, .svg, .png, .gif and .mp4 files.
