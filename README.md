# Projects for the 3DMP laboratory - FMI @ UniBuc

## Software used:

- Autodesk Fusion 360
- PrusaSlicer

## Homework:

### [Homework 1](https://github.com/DanNimara/3DMP/tree/master/Homework1)
  
### [Homework 2](https://github.com/DanNimara/3DMP/tree/master/Homework2):
  - Tasks:
    1. Download a model from Thingiverse and modify it. Slice it for 3D printing
and make a screenshot of the slicer window with the sliced object and the
selected option. Think of an useful improvement. If you’re happy with the
new design, upload it as a remix of the original.
    2. Model model A1(following the lab video tutorials), A2, A3, A4(following the
lab video tutorials) you can find the isometric schemes at this link:

    OBS: Turn on capture history when modeling the objects

### [Homework 3](https://github.com/DanNimara/3DMP/tree/master/Homework3):
   - Tasks:
      1. Turn on capture history (the homework will not be graded if capture history is not turned on).
      2. Import an SVG and design a chess pieces set:
          - 1 pawn,
          - 1 knight,
          - 1 bishop,
          - 1 rook,
          - 1 queen,
          - 1 king.
      3. Use the SVG sketch to revolve the pieces:
          - you need to take care when designing the knight; only the base
        should be revolved; find another solution for the horse part e.g:
        extrusion, fillet, etc.
          - when designing the bishop, revolve the part that doesn’t have the
        slit, and add the slit after.
      4. When using revolve, you need two things: the profile and the axis:
          - For the profile, you will use half of the chess piece (Fig.1 dark blue
        part)
          - For the axis, you will use a line that cuts the
        piece in half.
          - You need to add this line by yourself, editing the SVG sketch using
    constraints (don’t add it using a new sketch, it needs to be in the
    same sketch for the revolve to work).
      5. Use a circular pattern to add details on the top, neck and base of the
pieces.
      6. The SVG is a little bit stylized. The chess pieces contain smaller parts that
are not connected. For the full grade, you need to find a way to make each
chess piece only one body!
      7. Slice all the pieces in PrusaSlicer.
