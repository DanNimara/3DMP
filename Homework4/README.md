# HOMEWORK 4

   - Tasks:
       1. Watch and understand the courses videos about Rotational to Linear
          Motion and Vice-Versa mechanisms (We recommend to model them on
          your own as well)
       2. Design the Scotch Yoke Mechanism taking the course videos as reference
          (especially the slider crank mechanism; in this one can see why it’s
          important to use Fusion Rule Number 1)
            - Divide the mechanism into components
            - Use Fusion Rule Number 1
            - Design the model having in mind that it will be 3D printed
            - Rename your bodies, components, sketches, etc
            - Add appearances
            - Add joints
            - Create a motion study
        3. Create a scene with a twisted column on a polygon surface (Fig. 3.1)
            - Use polygons tool to create the base (3DMP Lab #5.1)
            - Replace the top face of the base with a custom surface to create
              the specific landscape for the column (3DMP Lab #5.5)
            - Create a twisted column. Use sweep for the body of the
            - column (3DMP Lab #5.4) and loft for it’s bottom and top part (3DMP
              Lab #5.2 and 3DMP Lab #5.3)
            - Add appearance on the model, render it, and make a photo of the
              render (3DMP Course #3.9 and 3DMP Course #3.10)
        OBS: Turn on capture history (the homework will not be graded if capture
        history is not turned on).
