# Projects for the 3DMP laboratory - FMI @ UniBuc

## Software used:

- Autodesk Fusion 360
- PrusaSlicer

## Homework:

### Homework 1:
  - Tasks:
    1. Create a 3D pixel art style keychain. By starting from a 2D sketch you need to fit those specific dimensions: 10 cm (X) x 7 cm (Y) x  1 cm (Z) 
    2. Create a 3D model vase starting from a 2D sketch  
    3. Edit the vase shape by modifying the 2D sketch 
    4. Slice both models in Prusa Slicer using different ways to find out the optimal time for printing 
  
### Homework 2:
  - Tasks:
    1. Download a model from Thingiverse and modify it. Slice it for 3D printing
and make a screenshot of the slicer window with the sliced object and the
selected option. Think of an useful improvement. If youâ€™re happy with the
new design, upload it as a remix of the original.
    2. Model model A1(following the lab video tutorials), A2, A3, A4(following the
lab video tutorials) you can find the isometric schemes at this link:
